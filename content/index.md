## What makes a web site *effective*?
Our <a href="/web-strategy/">Web Strategy</a> section is about making sure your web site is
 **doing the right things**. Web sites don't exist for their own sake, 
 but as part of a **communication 
strategy** to **deliver a message** and more importantly to
**engage your audience** in a conversation. In some circles this is called
"marketing", but it is much broader and more important than just selling a product
or raising awareness. It's about **spreading knowledge** and **inspiring
action**. Effective web sites **empower and inspire** people to take
 action.

## How do you build web sites *effectively*?
Our <a href="/web-development/">Web Development</a> section is about **doing things right**. **Highly effective, low-cost, high-performance web sites**
are the result of **good architecture** and the proper application
of **web standards**, not tricks and hacks. When you understand the 
core principles of effective web development, you can 
create **valuable, effective web sites** with great speed and reasonable 
cost.
