# About Webquills

Webquills.net is a collection of essays on the craft of creating effective web
sites, authored by me, Vince Veselosky, a web application architect. I talk
about topics like scalability, performance, usability, architecture, front-end
vs. back-end engineering, and anything else that comes to mind. This site is
mostly about technology, but the technology only exists to serve some higher
purpose, and I will occasionally delve into the *why* as well as the *what*.

## The Problem
A few years ago businesses and non-profit organizations questioned whether they needed a web presence at all. Those days are over. Now every organization assumes they need a web site as a matter of course, just like business cards. 

Unfortunately, many organizations put about as much thought into their web strategy as they do into their business card strategy. Which is to say, almost none. They go to a web designer and say "build us a web site" and then carry on with their business until the designer comes back with something pretty with their name on it. They sign a check, upload some files to a server, and figure they are "done" with their web strategy. This is a recipe for wasted web money and failure. An ineffective web site sits on the Internet consuming money and serving no one.

## The Solution
To succeed in the 21st century, your web site must be a cornerstone of your overall strategy. Whether the mission is for-profit or non-profit in nature, every organization has a mission to accomplish and a community to serve. An effective web site acts as a hub, connecting your community and facilitating your mission. It attracts visitors, engages them, informs them, persuades them to your point of view, and motivates them to act on behalf of your mission.

The mission of Webquills is to supply the knowledge needed to create successful, effective web sites.
