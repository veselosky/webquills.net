# About Webquills.net

## The Design
The design of Webquills.net is based on <a href="http://www.styleshout.com/templates/preview/EliteCircle1-1/index.html">EliteCircle 1.1</a>, 
a free, W3C-compliant, CSS-based website template by
<a href="http://www.styleshout.com/">styleshout.com</a>. The design is generously
distributed under the <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/">
Creative Commons Attribution 2.5  License</a>. I adapted the EliteCircle CSS for use
with the [YUI CSS framework](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/), and modified it heavily
for Webquills.net. Please assume that any bugs, layout errors, or generally unattractive
bits are mine and not the fault of <a href="http://www.styleshout.com/">styleshout.com</a>.

## The Technology
Webquills.net is build with [web standards](http://www.webstandards.org/). The server-side 
environment uses [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org) with [Mod-Perl](http://perl.apache.org),
and dynamic pages are constructed with [HTML::Mason](http://masonhq.com), a template system
and lightweight web framework. The underlying content management software is all custom 
built in [Perl](http://www.perl.org).
