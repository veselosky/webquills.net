Subtitle: Crafting Effective Web Sites
Author: Vince Veselosky

Webquills.net is a collection of essays on the craft of creating effective web
sites, authored by me, Vince Veselosky, a web application architect. I talk
about topics like scalability, performance, usability, architecture, front-end
vs. back-end engineering, and anything else that comes to mind. This site is
mostly about technology, but the technology only exists to serve some higher
purpose, and I will occasionally delve into the *why* as well as the *what*.
