<h2>What makes a web site <em>effective</em>?</h2>
<p>Our <a href="/web-strategy/">Web Strategy</a> section is about making sure your web site is
 <strong>doing the right things</strong>. Web sites don't exist for their own sake, but as part of a <strong>communication 
strategy</strong> to <strong>deliver a message</strong> and more importantly to
<strong>engage your audience</strong> in a conversation. In some circles this is called
"marketing", but it is much broader and more important than just selling a product
or raising awareness. It's about <strong>spreading knowledge</strong> and <strong>inspiring
action</strong>. Effective web sites <strong>empower and inspire</strong> people to take
 action.

<h2>How do you build web sites <em>effectively</em>?</h2>

of <strong>web standards</strong>, not tricks and hacks. When you understand the 
core principles of effective web development, you can 
create <strong>valuable, effective web sites</strong> with great speed and reasonable
